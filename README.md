# Pulse-Dialer
I needed to test if Verizon FiOS would work with a rotary phone before I bought an antique.  This code does it.

You need to pull the phone off the hook.
Hear a dial tone?
Power the Arduino  (or if it's powered, hit reset).

You need a wired phone, and wired phone service.
I was surprised when the Fios  Optical Network Terminal (ONT) was able to interpret the make/break pattern of the pulse dialer to initiate a call.
I didn't think it would do it.

My wife has a whimsey and wants a red dial phone on the kitchen wall and not a touch-tone one.
Before we buy an antique, I wanted to ensure it would work.
Have fun.
